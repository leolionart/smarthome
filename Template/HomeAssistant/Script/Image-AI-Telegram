        Motion has been detected, compare and very briefly describe what you see
        in the following sequence of images from my driveway camera number 1.
        What do you think caused the motion alarm? If a person or car is
        present, describe them in detail. Do not describe stationary objects or
        buildings. If you see no obvious causes of motion, reply with "Camera
        has detected motion however no obvious motion observed comparing
        snapshots". Your message needs to be short enough to fit in a phone
        notification.
